Task-1

Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

The dataset is taken from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwitiderrick/stockprice/master/NSE-TATAGLOBAL.csv. In this model I used the Stacked LSTM(Long Short Term Memory). A Machine Learning Model for Stock Market Prediction. Stock market prediction and forecasting using Stacked LSTM is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on a financial exchange.


Task-2 

Developing A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting using Tensorflow and CNN

The dataset is taken from MNIST (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). This project uses neural network machine learning for the classification of MNIST Handwritten Digit by using Sequential model and various layers such as Dense, Dropout,Conv2D,Flatten, MaxPooling2D.
