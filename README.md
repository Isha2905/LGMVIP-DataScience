Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

The dataset is taken from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwitiderrick/stockprice/master/NSE-TATAGLOBAL.csv. In this model I used the Stacked LSTM(Long Short Term Memory). A Machine Learning Model for Stock Market Prediction. Stock market prediction and forecasting using Stacked LSTM is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on a financial exchange.
